# Postgres Visual Semantic Knowledge Graph (Cloud SQL)

![Space Graph](https://github.com/billyjacobson/cloud-sql-pgvector-graph/blob/main/space-graph.png?raw=true)

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll visualize facts about Space Exploration and Astrophysics as a semantic knowledge graph using Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), `pgvector`, and `pyvis`.

The steps performed include:

*   Configure a Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) instance.
*   Enable the `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search.
*   Generate semantic embeddings for text data using `sentence-transformers`.
*   Store and query vector data in PostgreSQL.
*   Visualize the relationships between data points using `pyvis`.

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:

*   **Cloud SQL**: Costs are associated with the instance size and storage used.

Learn about [Cloud SQL pricing](https://cloud.google.com/sql/pricing) and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.


## Features

*   **Vector Search**: Uses `pgvector` to find semantically similar facts based on embeddings generated by `sentence-transformers`.
*   **Interactive Visualization**: Renders a dynamic, physics-based graph using `pyvis` where nodes are facts and edges represent semantic similarity.
*   **Secure**: Configured to use Google Colab's `userdata` for secure credential management.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have:

1.  **Google Cloud Project**: A GCP project with billing enabled.
2.  **Cloud SQL Instance**: A PostgreSQL instance (version 15+) with `pgvector` supported.
3.  **Database Credentials**:
    *   Connection Name (e.g., `project:region:instance`)
    *   Database User
    *   Database Password
    *   Database Name
